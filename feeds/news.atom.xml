&lt;p&gt;Thankfulness is the key to happiness  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you never received a thanks for a project you made for a friend, sometimes you &lt;a href="https://github.com/foxmask/wallabag_api/issues/1"&gt;received a thanks&lt;/a&gt; from unknown people who just had fun with a little piece of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Source is like that ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, recently I crossed the road of a funny project &lt;a href="https://saythanks.io/"&gt;"Say thanks"&lt;/a&gt;. Which permits to drop a little word to the author of the project you enjoyed.
This project looks as clear and clean, as we usually see projects by &lt;a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/"&gt;Kenneth Reitz,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://python-requests.org"&gt;"Mister Requests"&lt;/a&gt;. The strength is the simplicity. (I am asking myself if he does not play chess too, where strength in simplicity is often met:). I noticed a detail about the &lt;a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/saythanks.io/blob/master/README.md"&gt;README of his project&lt;/a&gt; "Random inspiration Links" ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, if you have enjoyed &lt;a href="https://trigger-happy.eu"&gt;Trigger Happy&lt;/a&gt;, just drop me a word from &lt;a href="https://saythanks.io/to/foxmask"&gt;&lt;img alt="Say thanks to" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/SayThanks.io-%E2%98%BC-1EAEDB.svg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry></feed>
